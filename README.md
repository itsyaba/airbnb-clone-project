# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone project is a full-stack application designed to replicate the core features of Airbnb. The goal is to create a platform where users can list properties, browse available stays, make bookings, and leave reviews — while ensuring secure transactions and smooth user experience.  

**Project Goals:**
- Build a scalable, maintainable web application.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for property listings and reservations.
- Implement secure authentication, authorization, and payments.
- Showcase full-stack development skills, including backend, frontend, and DevOps.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Backend:** Django
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **API Layer:** GraphQL
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js
- **Containerization & Deployment:** Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## Team Roles
Each role is crucial for building and maintaining the project.  

- **Backend Developer:** Implements RESTful/GraphQL APIs, handles business logic, integrates with the database, and ensures scalability.  
- **Frontend Developer:** Builds responsive UI components, connects to APIs, and ensures seamless user experience.  
- **Database Administrator (DBA):** Designs, manages, and optimizes database schema and queries for performance and integrity.  
- **DevOps Engineer:** Automates deployments, sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages containers, and ensures system reliability.  
- **QA Engineer:** Tests features, writes automated test cases, and ensures the platform is bug-free.  
- **Project Manager:** Coordinates the team, manages timelines, and ensures milestones are delivered.

## Technology Stack
- **Django** → A Python web framework for building APIs and backend logic.  
- **PostgreSQL** → A powerful relational database to manage user, property, and booking data.  
- **GraphQL** → Provides a flexible query language for the frontend to interact with APIs efficiently.  
- **React / Next.js** → Handles the client-side interface, offering SSR (server-side rendering) and fast performance.  
- **Docker** → Containerizes the application for consistency across environments.  
- **GitHub Actions** → Automates testing, building, and deployment.

## Database Design
**Key Entities:**
1. **Users**  
   - Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role` (guest/host).  
   - Relationship: A user can book properties or list properties if host.  

2. **Properties**  
   - Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`, `location`.  
   - Relationship: Belongs to a host (user). Can have multiple bookings.  

3. **Bookings**  
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status`.  
   - Relationship: Belongs to a user and a property.  

4. **Reviews**  
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`.  
   - Relationship: A review is written by a user for a property.  

5. **Payments**  
   - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `transaction_date`.  
   - Relationship: Linked to a booking and user.

## Feature Breakdown
- **User Management** → Handles sign-up, login, and user profile management.  
- **Property Management** → Hosts can list, update, and remove properties.  
- **Booking System** → Guests can search properties, check availability, and make reservations.  
- **Review System** → Guests can leave ratings and comments on properties.  
- **Payments** → Securely process booking transactions and refunds.  
- **Search & Filtering** → Users can filter properties by location, price, or availability.

## API Security
To protect sensitive data and ensure safe transactions, we’ll implement:  
- **Authentication:** Secure login/signup with JWT or OAuth.  
- **Authorization:** Role-based access (guest vs host vs admin).  
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse of APIs by limiting requests.  
- **Data Encryption:** Secure storage of passwords (hashed) and transactions (TLS/SSL).  

**Why Security Matters:**  
- Protects user personal and payment data.  
- Prevents unauthorized access to properties and bookings.  
- Ensures trust in the platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) ensures smooth and automated development flow.  

- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Runs automated tests and linting on every push/PR to catch bugs early.  
- **CD (Continuous Deployment):** Automatically builds Docker images and deploys the latest changes.  

**Tools:**  
- **GitHub Actions** → Workflow automation for builds and tests.  
- **Docker** → Packaging app into containers.  
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean** → Deployment options for production.
