# Airbnb Clone Project  

## Overview  
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack application that replicates the core functionality of Airbnb. The platform allows users to **list properties**, **browse available stays**, **make bookings**, **leave reviews**, and **handle secure payments**.  

### Project Goals  
- Build a **scalable and maintainable** web application.  
- Deliver a **user-friendly interface** for property listings and reservations.  
- Implement **secure authentication, authorization, and payments**.  
- Showcase **full-stack development skills** (backend, frontend, DevOps).  

### Technology Overview  
The project uses a **modern technology stack** combining backend, database, frontend, and deployment tools to ensure performance, scalability, and developer productivity.  

---

## Team Roles  
Each role is crucial to the success of the project:  

- **Backend Developer** → Builds APIs (REST/GraphQL), handles business logic, and ensures scalability.  
- **Frontend Developer** → Develops responsive UI, connects with APIs, and delivers seamless UX.  
- **Database Administrator (DBA)** → Designs schemas, optimizes queries, and ensures data integrity.  
- **DevOps Engineer** → Automates deployments, manages containers, and maintains CI/CD pipelines.  
- **QA Engineer** → Writes automated/manual tests and ensures bug-free releases.  
- **Project Manager** → Oversees progress, coordinates roles, and ensures timely delivery.  

---

## Technology Stack  
- **Django** → Python web framework for backend APIs, authentication, and business logic.  
- **PostgreSQL** → Relational database to store users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments.  
- **GraphQL** → Flexible API query language for efficient frontend–backend communication.  
- **React / Next.js** → Modern frontend framework with SSR (Server-Side Rendering) for performance.  
- **Docker** → Containerizes the application for consistent development and deployment.  
- **GitHub Actions** → Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows.  
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean** → Cloud platforms for hosting production deployments.  

### How They Work Together  
- **Django + PostgreSQL** manage core data and business rules.  
- **GraphQL** provides optimized data fetching for the frontend.  
- **React/Next.js** delivers a dynamic and responsive interface.  
- **Docker + GitHub Actions** ensure consistent builds and automated deployments.

## Database Design  

### Key Entities  

1. **Users**  
   - Fields: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`, `date_joined`  
   - Relationships:  
     - Can book properties (guest role).  
     - Can list properties (host role).  

2. **Properties**  
   - Fields: `property_id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`, `location`, `created_at`  
   - Relationships:  
     - Belongs to a host (user).  
     - Can have multiple bookings and reviews.  

3. **Bookings**  
   - Fields: `booking_id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status`  
   - Relationships:  
     - Linked to a user (guest).  
     - Linked to a property.  
     - Associated with a payment.  

4. **Reviews**  
   - Fields: `review_id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`  
   - Relationships:  
     - Written by a user about a property.  

5. **Payments**  
   - Fields: `payment_id`, `user_id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `transaction_date`  
   - Relationships:  
     - Tied to a booking and the user who paid.  

### Relationships Overview  
- A **user** can be a **guest** (makes bookings) or a **host** (lists properties).  
- A **property** belongs to a host and can have many **bookings** and **reviews**.  
- A **booking** links a **user** and a **property**, and it requires a **payment**.  
- A **review** is created by a guest about a booked property.  
- A **payment** confirms a booking and ensures transaction security.  

---

## Feature Breakdown  
- **User Management** → Sign-up, login, and profile management.  
- **Property Management** → Hosts can list, update, and remove properties.  
- **Booking System** → Guests can search properties, check availability, and make reservations.  
- **Review System** → Guests can leave ratings and comments on properties.  
- **Payments** → Securely process booking transactions and refunds.  
- **Search & Filtering** → Filter properties by location, price, or availability.  

---

## API Security  
To protect sensitive data and ensure safe transactions, we implement:  

- **Authentication** → Secure login/signup with JWT or OAuth.  
- **Authorization** → Role-based access (guest vs host vs admin).  
- **Rate Limiting** → Prevent API abuse by limiting requests.  
- **Data Encryption** → Store passwords securely (hashing) and secure transactions with TLS/SSL.  

### Why Security Matters  
- Protects personal and payment data.  
- Prevents unauthorized access to properties and bookings.  
- Builds trust between users and the platform.  

---

## CI/CD Pipeline  
**CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)** ensures faster, safer, and automated delivery of code.  

- **CI (Continuous Integration)** → Runs automated tests and linting on every push/PR to catch bugs early.  
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)** → Builds Docker images and deploys the latest changes automatically.  

### Benefits  
- Faster and more reliable deployments.  
- Reduced manual errors through automation.  
- Early detection of bugs and issues.  
- Consistent environment setup across development and production.  

### Tools  
- **GitHub Actions** → Workflow automation for builds, tests, and deployments.  
- **Docker** → Containerization for consistent runtime environments.  
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean** → Platforms for deploying the app to production.
